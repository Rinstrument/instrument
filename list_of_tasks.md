Woo Hoo!!!!


March 1, 2023: 
 - use the clark article to get the 3pl up and running
 - confirm that the higher-order thing is working correctly
 - is lambda_ind wrong???

March 2, 2023:
 - may need to exagerate effects and then rescale! - sim step
 - finish writing introduction
 - Write model section
 - Simulation study? - choose a model and settings
 - Case study: asti data with covariates
 - Case study from a couple different perspectives with R code
 - Missing data in all places of model now appropriate - need to add
 - hook up the mirt model and confirmatory mirt
